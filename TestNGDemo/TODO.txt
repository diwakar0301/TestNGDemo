			TESTNG ---> test level will have more control for classes and methods but suite level won't have such powerful controls over classes & methods
				    

1.timeout
2.data provider ---> parallel & data-provider-thread-count
3.tests ---> parallel in suite level with thread count
4.classes ---> parallel in suite level with thread count
5.classes ---> parallel in test level with thread count
6.methods ---> parallel in suite level with thread count
7.methods ---> parallel in test level with thread count
8.invocation count(execute further invocation even though if any exception occurs at first invocation 
but normal loops won't execute frther invocation if any exception occurs at first invocation
), 
invocation timeout, 
threadpoolsize

9. before java version 8 -> interfaces won't have implemented method that is all are abstract 
10. testng version 7 and above uses java 8 version
11.suite level listeners
12.test level listeners
13. difference between listeners and annotation like(@AfterMethod,.....).
	listeners will listen to the each and every events and track the status but annotation don't have such feature.
extending TestListenerAdapter Class is equal to implementing all listeners interface
14. @Factory
